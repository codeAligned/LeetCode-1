January, jurors will weigh whether Roof, 22, should be sentenced to death or spend the rest of his life in prison.
Deliberations began Thursday afternoon in Roof's murder trial after attorneys made closing arguments.
Shortly after deliberations started, the jury asked to again watch the video in which Roof confessed to two FBI agents. Specifically, the jury wanted to see the portion where Roof was unsure of how many people he had killed.
